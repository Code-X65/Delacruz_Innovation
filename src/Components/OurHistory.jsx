            Founded in 2017 in the United Kingdom, Delacruz Innovations was built on one belief - that Africa deserves technology solutions engineered with the same precision and ambition as global leaders.

            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              From our early beginnings delivering IT consultancy and transformation projects in the UK public and private sectors, we saw an opportunity to bring that value home - to Lagos, Nigeria and redefine what excellence in digital innovation means locally.

            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
             Today, Delacruz Innovations stands as a bridge between international best practice and Nigerian business realities. We partner with organisations across government, education, finance, and enterprise, helping them modernise their systems, automate workflows, and empower their teams with tools built for the future of work.

          <br /> <br />

We’re not just building software  we’re building capacity, competitiveness, and confidence in Africa’s digital economy.

            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The year 2019 marked significant team growth as we expanded to over 500 dedicated consultants and technologists. We built centers of excellence around the world, bringing together diverse talent to solve complex business challenges.
